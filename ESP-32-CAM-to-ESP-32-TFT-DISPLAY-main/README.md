ðŸ”§ Features:

ESP32-CAM setup for camera capture and data transmission

ESP32 + TFT display ST7735 for live feed display

Communication over Wi-Fi

Designed for robotics or remote monitoring projects

Lightweight, optimized code for real-time image display

ðŸš€ Great for DIY surveillance, remote robots, or creative IoT displays.

When uploading code to ESP-32 CAM, the esp32 board library in board manager needs to be version 1.0.4.
When uploading code to ESP-32 with the connected tft display, the esp32 board library in board manager needs to near the latest versions.

You need to add the libraries provided in you arduinos library folder
